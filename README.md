# Binary Operations
This program performs various operations with binary numbers, including conversions, shifting, and arithmetic (signed, unsigned, IEEE 754). It supports different bases and formats.

## List of operations

### 1. Conversions
   - **to Binary**: Convert each base you want to binary
   - **to Hexadecimal**: Convert each base you want to hexadecimal
   - **to Decimal**: Convert each base you want to decimal
   - **to Custom base**: convert each base you want to a custom base

### 2. Shifting Operations
   - **Logical Shifts**: Shift bits to the left or right by a specified number of positions and fill the rest with 0's
   - **Arithmetic Shifts**: Shift bits to the left or right by a specified number of positions and fill the rest with the signed of the number
   - **Circular Shifts**: Rotate bits to the left or right circularly

### 3. Arithmetic Operations
   - **Addition / Subtraction**: Perform addition and subtraction of binary numbers (signed, unnsigned, IEEE 754 format)
   - **Multiplication / Division**: Perform multiplication and division of binary numbers (signed, unnsigned, IEEE 754 format)
